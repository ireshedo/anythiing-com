#### Description: 
Anythiing.com is a web application that can create quizzes based on any topic in the world. Users are able to test their knowledge on certain topics just by typing in a topic into the text input at the start page and a quiz will be generated shortly after. Users can decide the amount of questions on the quiz (From 1 to 50) and can also add a timer for each question (1-30 seconds). Users that are logged in have access to their quiz history and have the ability to retake any quiz on the history menu by clicking it. The users score on the test is also shown on the history menu. Another thing that users have the ability to do is view a bar chart displaying what their percentage is of quizzes taken in each subject. When a quiz is generated a subject is applied to it and the grade of that score is added to the overall total per subject inside of the bar chart. In the web application code I used Python, Flask, Javascript, HTML and CSS to create the web application and VScode was my IDE.
